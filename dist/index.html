                            <p>I am currently following a Master of Science in Industrial Design at Eindhoven University of Technology. I am following the track Research Design & Development (RDD) and focus on 3 expertise areas: technology & realization, user & society, and design & research processes. I also participate in 2 certificate programmes: Technology Entrepreneurship & Management and Technology for Sustainable Development. This way, I want to gain knowledge about designing from different perspectives.

                            <p>In my first year of my bachelor Industrial Design, I visited the Milano Design Week with a organised trip of the study association of Industrial Design. I became very enthusiastic about the city and noticed that the environment inspired me a lot. Because of this inspiring experience and the interesting range of courses they offer at Politecnico di Milano, I decided to go on an exchange semester to Milan. As a student and as a designer, I would like to get the most out of my studies. I saw this exchange as an unique opportunity to broaden my horizon and to gain experience about different cultures and about designing from new perspectives. Besides, I saw this exchange experience as an opportunity to build an international network and to learn about different cultures.</p>

                            <p>I received my Bachelor of Science in Industrial Design from Eindhoven University of Technology. I have developed myself broadly and learned to carry out a design process independently. I developed within six expertise areas determined by the faculty of Industrial Design: user & society, business & entrepreneurship, technology & realisation, math data & computing, creativity & aesthetics, and design & research processes. In my minor, I followed courses at the faculty of Applied Mathematics. Besides, I followed the USE (User, Society and Entrepreneurial perspective) learning line about light.</p>

Unfortunately, during the first game of this tournament, I suffered an injury, which meant that I also had to miss the European Championship. Due to Lyme disease and injuries, I decided in May 2016 to stop at Papendal and to stop playing for the Dutch National team under 18.  </p>
